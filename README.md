# Gentoo portage overlay for libreoffice-5.2.7.2

This is my overlay for Gentoo linux portage prepared to install 
libreoffice-5.2.7.2.

Recently Gentoo removed this version from it's
official portage (with
[this](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/commit/3a24c17403089bc00cd15c99f3f76f8c9408ef97)
commit) leaving only versions 5.4.2.2 and 5.4.3.2. Unfortunately, none
of these two is able to open docx files. Not that I like docx, but I
need a way to open these files (more
[here](https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8146892.html)). So I
prepared this overlay to be able to install older version and use it
until Gentoo provides ebuild for
working libreoffice version.
